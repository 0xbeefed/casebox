==============================
New Features, Improvements
--------------------------
- Basic Api model
    apache config for host should be updated ( install/httpd/ssl_casebox.conf )
- due to psr0 adjustments, for custom cores code, we advice to:
    - define custom code classes into custom namespace (name of the core)
    - place custom code classes under php/<custom namespace>/ forder of your core
    - accessed casebox functions and constants should pe prefixed with \CB\
    - classes defined in api, to be accessible in javascript, should be prefixed with "<custom_namespace>_" (ex. sample_CustomClass)
    - from custom javascript files api methods are also prefixed with namespace with underline after it (ex. sample_CustomClass.customMethod(params, this.processResponse, this) ).
