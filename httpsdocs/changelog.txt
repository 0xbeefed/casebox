CaseBox 1.9.15 (2013-08-22)
==============================
New Features, Improvements
--------------------------
-   added security inheritance checkbox in interface 
    and modified database triggers to take this flag into account.

Notes: You should only update database structure after switching to this release (20130822_0014 mysql_database_structure_update.sql).
    Generally there is no need to run any other scripts, 
    because inheritance was enabled by default and checkbox was not available before.

- renaming an object did not display changes instantly in interface
- display the correct username in main casebox menu

==============================
New Features, Improvements
--------------------------
- Basic Api model
    apache config for host should be updated ( install/httpd/ssl_casebox.conf )
- due to psr0 adjustments, for custom cores code, we advice to:
    - define custom code classes into custom namespace (name of the core)
    - place custom code classes under php/<custom namespace>/ forder of your core
    - accessed casebox functions and constants should pe prefixed with \CB\
    - classes defined in api, to be accessible in javascript, 
        should be prefixed with "<custom_namespace>_" (ex. sample_CustomClass)
    - from custom javascript files api methods are also prefixed with namespace with underline after it 
        (ex. sample_CustomClass.customMethod(params, this.processResponse, this) ).
