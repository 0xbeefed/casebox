The project will be available on GitHub, it depends on other software described after the main folder structure:

1. Architecture   

/ casebox
    - config.ini
    / sys                       (scripts, files used by CaseBox platform)
        / crons                 (data processing cron jobs)
        / templates             (email templates)
    
    / data                      (all files generated by cores)
        / solr
            / conf              (global conf for all cores, can be overwritten per core)
            / data
                / [core-name]   (SOLR index files)
                 
        / files   
            / [core-name]
        / sessions
            / [core-name]       (php session objects, in the near future will be moved to DB)

    
    / install                   (instructions how to install CaseBox on Win/Linux and sample configs for Apache, SOLR, MySql)
        - readme.txt            (a step by step guide how to run CaseBox)
        \ httpd
           - readme.txt         (snippets of apache config options to be added to httpd.conf)
        \ solr
           - readme.txt         (how to install&configure solr, symlink to /opt/solr, then copy files below into correct folders and rename them...)
           - jetty_service      (/etc/rc.d/init.d/jetty service)
           - jetty_config       (/etc/default/jetty file)
           - solr.xml           (/opt/solr/multicore/solr.xml file)

        \ mysql
           - readme.txt         (maybe different mysql.ini configs based on RAM, expected server load etc)

        \ php
            - readme.txt        (php.ini variables to be changed)

        \ libreoffice
            - readme.txt        (how to install libreoffice, the unoconv connector and the start-office script to launch it)
            - start-office      (the script to launch office in headless mode)

    / httpdocs                  (a dummy folder if the system is accessed by HTTP or an intro website)
        / manual                (CaseBox manual)
    
    / httpsdocs                 (HTTPS web entry point)
        / cores                 (custom core configuration, JS and PHP classes. Not included in CaseBox Git repo)
            / cb_[core-name]    (CaseBox core can be managed as a Git repo)

            / cb_sample         (a sample CaseBox core)
                / css
                / js
                / php
                - system.ini    (a system.ini example with dummy passwords and a commented line that should load config.ini
                                That's the core config with DB passwords and private settings not available in Git)
                
                - config.ini    (a config.ini example.                                    
                                 main configuration file with core Name, Description and config settings 
                                that tells CaseBox how to link to 3rd party functionality in this folder
                                (the idea of having two configs is for project collaboration via Git
                                the system.ini file can be specific per server, and shouldn't be shared.
                                config.ini should be the same for all project collaborators, but this file is not mandatory
                                system.ini may have a list of INI files loaded by CaseBox, like an Include=config.ini
                                This will allow collaborators to specify there own config.ini file for local development 
                                on their computers, while having a shared config.ini for the whole project)

            / css                (CaseBox css, images)
            / js                 (CaseBox JS classes)
            / libx               (external libraries like ExtJS, Zend, that are not part of CaseBox platform)
                / ext
                / zend
                / solr
                / min            (JS and CSS minifier, also used by 3rd party setups)

            / lib                (CaseBox additional libraries)
            
            / remote             (CaseBox PHP classes linked to JS through Ext.Direct library)
                \ classes        (PHP classes defined in config.php file)
                - config.php     (Ext.Direct server side handlers)
    / logs                       (HTTPS logs)
